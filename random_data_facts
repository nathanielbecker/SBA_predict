correlation of various variables with p(loan):
(+) got loan recently
(+) really low interest rate (even holding constant year of loan)
(+) didn't default (not big positive signal)

Not very correlated with p(loan):
size of loan
ratio of guaranteed portion to total portion


with a forest, you can get up to 6% accuracy (cutting off first 10k top-voted businesses, for some reason)
